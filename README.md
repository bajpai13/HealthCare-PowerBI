# HealthCare-PowerBI Dashboard & Report


A custom dashboard I created using Power BI! I used the Healthcare dataset for this endeavor, a fictional dataset that contains comprehensive data about Hospital Patients. 

The project's core objectives are to create a dynamic Business Intelligence solution using Power BI Desktop that connects and transforms raw data from CSV files, establishes a robust relational data model, employs Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) to calculate crucial KPIs, facilitates healthcare outcomes.
